About this project
==

I basically started this project because I can't keep track of the movies I want to see. With the help of this little tool, I may be able to add and cross out some flicks, therefore I'll miss less or none of them.

What you'll need
==

You'll need the following services to run the application:
* Any HTTP daemon that can handle PHP 5.3
* PHP 5.3 (may run on earlier versions, not tested)
* MongoDB (any version basically, there's only insert, find and findOne)
* MongoDB library for PHP
* Memcache is optional, but it comes handy when you have to query RottenTomatoes
* A RottenTomatoes API key

Configuration
==

I'll make some sample config files, I swear.
